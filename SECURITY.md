# Security Policy

In the unlikely event you discover a security issue involving the CVE-CNA discord
server, please report those issues privately to anyone with the @moderator role.

In all likelihood, though, you probably found a security issue with either
Discord itself, or the bots we use.

## Discord issues

Discord runs a bug bounty, at <https://discord.com/security>

## Bot issues

We use [Dyno](https://dyno.gg) for some things, and you can report security vulnerabilities
involing Dyno by:

* Joining their [Support server](https://discord.gg/N2TKYgh)
* Messaging [Dave the Robot](https://discordapp.com/users/174603896990203905) and selecting "Other" 

Alternatively, feel free to share your bug with [Tod](https://keybase.io/todb) and we'll
work it out.
