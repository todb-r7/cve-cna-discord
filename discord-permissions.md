# User roles

All the **Everyone** group can do is see the #verification channel. The
Everyone group includes non-humans, that is, users that have not yet been
verified as human.

**Human** users are human. Some are **CNA**, **Working-Group**, and **Board** users.
Everyone (not to be confused with **Everyone** group) is human. Many of them
will be also be CNAs, and a few will be WG and Board users. However, it is
possible to have **Board** or **Working-Group** roles and *not* have the **CNA**,
so we need to repeat permissions among those three groups.

**CNA** users are associated with the functions of a CNA, and have access to
CNA categorized chats. All current CNAs are listed
[here](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners), but note that
CNAs are nearly always an organization (a company or an open source project).
If a person's status changes (usually through a job change), then this role
should be removed. We're trying to limit CNA discussions to *just* current,
active CNAs.

**Working-Group** users are associated with one or more working groups, listed
[here](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/WorkingGroups). Just as with
CNA users, if someone leaves a working-group, their role should be removed.

**Board** users are on the CVE Editorial board, listed
[here](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/Board).

**Moderator** users are trusted with user management, and have kick/ban/edit
powers. There should be a handful of these. All moderators will also be either
CNAs or Working-Group users.

**Admin** users have all permissions. There should be two of these. Right now,
it's just the one,
[Tod B](https://gist.github.com/todb-r7/5dd0ce6715e42a0d21d8d27a25617133#verified-userids).

**Bot** has no inherent permissions, and **Dyno** is an externally managed
role for [Dyno](https://dyno.gg), a bot useful for verification of users among other
functions.

# Permissions

Discord has a pretty rich set of permissions, and can be assigned and enforced on individual
users, roles, categories, and channels. That said, all user permissions should be delegated
through their appropriate roles, unless there's a really good reason to be assigning or
revoking a permission for a specific user.

## Category permissions

New channels start in the "public text channels" list, unless they're marked
as private on creation. It's the responsibility of the channel creator to move
it to the right category.

## Channel permissions

Generally, channels don't have their own permissions, but inheret from their Categories.

Of special note: only **CNA**, **WG**, and **Board** users can create, edit, and delete
channels, since Discord is silly and doesn't provide [seperate create and
delete powers](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360043476072-A-Separate-Permission-to-delete-channels-)
on channels. Bummer. So in order to allow for creating new channels (including
private channels), we must trust those users not to just delete channels
willy-nilly (If it ever does happen, we'll have server logs and know who to pillory.)
