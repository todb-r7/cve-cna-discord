# CVE-CNA Discord Rules

All users will agree to these rules upon joining the server.

1. Read and agree to the Code of Conduct: https://github.com/todb-r7/cve-cna-discord/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

2. CNAs: You will assert you are involved in your organization's @cna functions once you validate your @human status in order to get the @cna role.

3. CNAs: If you change job functions and are no longer a @cna, you will volunteer this information to a @moderator so they may remove this role.

4. @working-group and @board members: If you are no longer involved at this level, please message a @moderator to excuse yourself.

5. We talk about security sensitive topics here, routinely. As such, members of this server will be respectful of the affected people's and organization's confidence, privacy, and reputation when handling security issues prior to public disclosure.

6. Nothing on Discord is end-to-end encrypted. It is possible for Discord insiders (employed and otherwise), admins, and bots to read your messages, including private and deleted messages. For very sensitive topics, you will use a more appropriate communications platform, such as Signal or Keybase

7. Server nicknames must follow the format of chosen_username (organization). People can use whatever name they like, but should know that if they are representing a CNA, this information will be obvious through their nicknames.
