# User permissions

All the **Everyone** group can do is see the #verification channel. The
Everyone group includes non-humans, that is, users that have not yet been
verified as human.

**Human** users are human. Some are **CNA**, **WG**, and **Board** users.
Everyone (not to be confused with **Everyone** group) is human. Many of them
will be also be CNAs, and a few will be WG and Board users. However, it is
possible to be in (Board|WG) and *not* in CNA, so we need to repeat
permissions among those three groups.

**Moderator** users are trusted with user management, and have kick/ban/edit
powers. There should be a handful of these.

**Admin** users have all permissions. There should be two of these.

**Early-Adopter** is a temporary group and will be removed when the server
goes live.

**Bot** has no inherent permissions, and **Dyno** is an externally managed
role for [Dyno](https://dyno.gg), a bot useful for verification of users.

## Category permissions

New channels start in the "public text channels" list, unless they're marked
as private on creation. It's on the channel creator to move it to the right
category.

## Channel permissions

Generally, channels don't have their own permissions, but inheret from their Categories.

Of special note: only **CNA**, **WG**, and **Board** users can create, edit, and delete
channels, since Discord is silly and doesn't provide [seperate create and
delete powers](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360043476072-A-Separate-Permission-to-delete-channels-)
on channels. Bummer. So in order to allow for creating new channels (including
private channels), we must trust those users not to just delete channels
willy-nilly (If it ever does happen, we'll have server logs and know who to pillory.)
